# CS2043-Project
This project is the final project for CS2043.

Please create and use branches and pull requests, do *not* push directly to main.

This spike is for testing serializing the whole array of ingredients rather than just which ingredients the user has- which allows us to store user ingredients in the same file but may be more difficult to implement and cause other unforeseen issues.

Ideally, when run, TestSerialization should import the default array list, print it, then create a modified list, save it, and exit.
If it is run while the modified list is present, it prints that instead, then deletes the file.
