Average Rating Spike:
Initial thoughts: 
1. Have the average rating function display the up-to-date rating by taking individual inputs from the user, not necessarily storing the individual ratings, but keeping track of the avg rating.

2. Have the array-list ratings for individual recipes, when a function still keeps track of the average, however, individual ratings can be accessed [problem: typical it’s a one user program, Solution: the most recent rating can be displayed for-front for the user].

1. MAIN ------
- Have an option to display recipes in order of best rating.

-Have a check to ensure user enters a valid rating [0 – 5]

--Decided to implement getter-setter functionality in case we implement an arraylist later.
--Returns a string so a GUI Text or Label can work.
--What if two ratings are the same??? [Maybe assign a specific user a specific index value if we're going the route of arraylist]
